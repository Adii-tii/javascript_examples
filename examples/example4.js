/**Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators like +, -, *, /, %
2. Assignment Operators like =, +=, -=, *=, /=
3. Comparison Operators like ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
4. Logical Operators like &&, ||, ! (and, or, not)
5. Bitwise Operators like &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>> 

== is loose equality operator that is it performs type coercion before comparing the two values
for instance '5 == 5' is true (because js converts string '5' to number 5 before comparison)
whereas === is strict equality operator for instance '5 === 5' is false because one is string and other 
is number
